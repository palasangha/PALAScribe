# Audio-Text Converter - Issues Fixed

## Summary of All Issues Addressed

### ✅ 1. Fixed "New Project" Creation
**Problem**: The "New Project" button and form were not working due to corrupted JavaScript code.

**Solution**: 
- Created a completely new, clean `ui-controller-fixed.js` file
- Restored proper event binding and form handling
- Fixed project creation workflow with proper error handling
- Projects now create successfully and automatically start audio processing

### ✅ 2. Removed Audio-Text Sync Code
**Problem**: Audio-text synchronization code was causing issues.

**Solution**:
- Identified and removed timestamp-based synchronization code from the corrupted ui-controller.js
- The new fixed controller doesn't include any audio-text sync functionality
- Simplified the transcription display to show plain formatted text without timestamp segments
- Removed clickable timestamp segments and audio progress synchronization

### ✅ 3. Fixed Preview Mode
**Problem**: Preview mode was transcribing entire audio instead of just first 60 seconds.

**Solution**:
- Preview mode was actually working correctly in the backend (whisper_server.py)
- The backend properly trims audio to 60 seconds when preview=true
- Fixed the frontend to properly pass the preview mode parameter
- Added clear UI indication when preview mode is enabled

### ✅ 4. Added Cancel Button for Processing
**Problem**: No way to cancel processing once started.

**Solution**:
- Created a new processing modal with a cancel button
- Added `btnCancelProcessing` element and event handler
- Implemented `cancelCurrentProcessing()` method
- Added process tracking with `currentProcessId` and `isProcessing` flags
- Cancel button properly terminates processing and cleans up incomplete projects

### ✅ 5. Improved Text Formatting
**Problem**: Converted text needed better formatting and indication that it's generated.

**Solution**:
- Implemented `formatTranscriptionText()` method with:
  - Header and footer markers: "=== GENERATED TRANSCRIPTION ==="
  - Automatic paragraph creation based on sentence boundaries
  - Better spacing for natural speech patterns
  - Pali term highlighting with `highlightPaliTerms()`
  - Professional text formatting with proper line breaks

### ✅ 6. Added Pali Text Styling
**Problem**: Pali text needed different font styling for distinction.

**Solution**:
- Added `.pali-text` CSS class with:
  - Serif font family (Times New Roman, Noto Serif)
  - Purple color (#7c3aed) for visual distinction  
  - Light gray background with rounded corners
  - Increased letter spacing and medium font weight
- Implemented pattern recognition for Pali terms:
  - Words with diacritics (āīūṅñṭḍṇḷṃḥṣṛ)
  - Common Pali words (dhamma, sangha, buddha, etc.)
- Added transcription text styling with serif fonts and proper spacing

## Files Modified

### New Files Created:
- `js/ui-controller-fixed.js` - Complete rewrite of the UI controller

### Files Modified:
- `index.html` - Added processing modal with cancel button, updated script references
- `css/styles.css` - Added Pali text and transcription formatting styles

### Files Removed:
- `ui-controller-patch.js` - No longer needed with the fixed controller

## Technical Implementation Details

### Processing Modal with Cancel
```html
<div id="processing-modal" class="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center hidden z-50">
    <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-8 max-w-md w-full mx-4">
        <div class="text-center">
            <div class="animate-spin rounded-full h-12 w-12 border-b-2 border-blue-600 mx-auto mb-4"></div>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Processing Audio</h3>
            <p id="processing-message" class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Converting your audio to text...</p>
            <button id="btn-cancel-processing" class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg transition-colors">
                Cancel
            </button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Pali Text Detection
```javascript
highlightPaliTerms(text) {
    const paliPatterns = [
        // Words with diacritics
        /\b\w*[āīūṅñṭḍṇḷṃḥṣṛ]\w*\b/g,
        // Common Pali words
        /\b(dhamma|dharma|sangha|buddha|nirvana|nibbana|samsara|karma|kamma|sutra|sutta|bhikkhu|bodhisattva)\b/gi
    ];
    
    paliPatterns.forEach(pattern => {
        text = text.replace(pattern, '<span class="pali-text">$&</span>');
    });
    
    return text;
}
```

### Enhanced Text Formatting
```javascript
formatTranscriptionText(transcription) {
    let formatted = transcription.trim();
    
    // Add header indicating this is generated content
    formatted = '=== GENERATED TRANSCRIPTION ===\n\n' + formatted;
    
    // Auto-paragraph: Split on sentence boundaries followed by longer pauses
    formatted = formatted.replace(/([.!?])\s{2,}/g, '$1\n\n');
    
    // Add paragraph breaks for typical speech patterns
    formatted = formatted.replace(/(\w+[.!?])\s+(Well|So|Now|Then|And then|But|However|Actually)/g, '$1\n\n$2');
    
    // Highlight potential Pali terms
    formatted = this.highlightPaliTerms(formatted);
    
    // Add footer
    formatted += '\n\n=== END TRANSCRIPTION ===';
    
    return formatted;
}
```
