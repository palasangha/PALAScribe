1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,880
Well, you have finished your 110-day Vipassana course, but this is not enough.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:18,080
Now you have to see how to apply it in your day-to-day life.

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:26,600
You will go out, you have to face the world, and whatever equanimity you have learned here,

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:33,680
you see that you apply that in your life in spite of all the difficult situations.

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:41,920
You know, I also know, the world is such that it is so difficult to apply equanimity in

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,480
life, but this is what you have to learn.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:59,440
For that, one important way is that you learn it in the atmosphere of a Dhamma center where

8
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
the course is going on.

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:10,800
You come sometime when you are free, you come and give a service, 10-day Dhamma service.

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,960
The atmosphere here is definitely better than the atmosphere outside.

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,880
Outside the entire atmosphere is full of negativities.

12
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:28,680
Here the students who come will also generate negativity time and again, but the atmosphere

13
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,840
around is such that it won't be so strong, you can face it.

14
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:45,880
So first you learn here how to remain equanimous, dealing with people who are generating negativity,

15
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,800
a training ground for you.

16
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,200
And moreover, the whole day you won't be giving any Dhamma service, whenever you are free,

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,720
you have opportunity to meditate.

18
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,360
This is how you will strengthen yourself.

19
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:09,880
Besides this, there are many more benefits of giving a Dhamma service.

20
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,820
One important benefit is that you will develop your parmitas.

21
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:23,440
It is only your parmitas which will take you to the final goal and you get a good opportunity

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,760
here while you are serving people to develop your parmita.

23
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:36,200
One parmita of mitha, whenever you serve people, naturally you generate mitha for them,

24
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:44,240
love, compassion for them, and that helps you to develop your own parmi of mitha.

25
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,980
Another more important parmi is the parmi of dana, especially for the householder.

26
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,080
It is a very important parmi.

27
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,340
You give dana of money, of things required by people in the world, good.

28
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:10,540
But here the dana is dana of Dhamma, the greatest dana in the world.

29
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,120
Why greatest?

30
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,480
Because the law of nature is such, whatever the seed you plant, the fruit will be exactly

31
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,960
that multiplied.

32
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,880
When you give food to somebody, in return, when time ripens, you will get food in bigger

33
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,680
quantities.

34
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,000
You are now joining to give dhamma.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,900
Of course, the teacher gives dhamma and it takes time for someone to reach the stage

36
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,360
of becoming a full-fledged teacher or even assistant teacher, but still you can be a

37
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,000
partner in this dhamma service, in this dhamma dana.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,040
Understand a teacher cannot give dhamma dana unless there is a proper facility.

39
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,840
So those people who are helping to construct proper facilities are also partner in giving

40
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,080
dhamma.

41
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,520
Similarly, dhamma cannot be given if there is no good management.

42
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,560
So those who are managing a dhamma course are also partner in dhamma dana.

43
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,460
And so also dhamma cannot be given unless there are good dhamma workers to help.

44
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,920
So you are also becoming a partner and you get the benefit out of it.

45
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,880
And I know how much benefit you get with my own experience.

46
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:43,680
From the day I took my first course, after finishing my first course, till I was appointed

47
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,360
a full-fledged teacher after 14 years, all these years from time to time I used to go

48
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,000
to my teacher and the centre to give service there, dhamma service.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,520
And how much benefit I got from that I know.

50
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,080
Similarly, the students who give dhamma service, they keep on deporting me that by giving a

51
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,520
one, ten day dhamma service, I got so much benefit.

52
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,320
When you plant the seed of dhamma, giving dana of dhamma is planting the seed of dhamma,

53
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,280
you get in return large quantity of dhamma for you.

54
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,200
Your dhamma becomes stronger and stronger.

55
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:26,020
This is a very good benefit you are going to get by giving dhamma service.

56
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:35,980
Another big benefit, you get so much satisfaction, satisfaction.

57
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,340
You have been served by so many people, so many dhamma workers, when you got dhamma,

58
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,540
now you feel that you are paying your debt of gratitude by serving other people in the

59
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,240
same way.

60
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,900
Others have served me, now I better serve others.

61
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,140
This is the great satisfaction that you have.

62
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,260
Another big satisfaction that you will have.

63
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:05,040
At the end of the course, you will feel so much of joy.

64
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:12,520
And this is not an ordinary joy, this is a very sublime joy, a sympathetic joy.

65
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:20,920
You notice when people join the course, their faces are full of melancholy, sadness, having

66
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,760
this kind of misery, that kind of misery.

67
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:32,160
But on the tenth day, when they leave the course, there is so much of glow on their

68
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,320
face, so much of happiness, so much of joy, and you generate sympathetic joy, you also

69
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
become so happy.

70
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,400
This is a very big advantage that you get from it.

71
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,840
Besides that, after all, dhamma is not only for your own liberation.

72
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,560
The thing of Buddha is that of course you liberate yourself, at the same time you help

73
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,560
others to get liberated, and then the same thing you are doing by giving dhamma service,

74
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,940
you are trying to liberate yourself from misery, and you are helping others to get liberated

75
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,940
from misery.

76
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:16,400
Therefore, I keep on advising my students that at least one ten-day course, you must

77
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,480
find time for at least one ten-day course to give dhamma service.

78
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,280
At least you find time for one ten-day course to take your own course.

79
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,520
Similarly, for service, one ten-day course is very important.

80
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,840
At times you can't find ten days, alright, then as many days as possible.

81
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,760
Maybe during the weekend you can come for two days, then have discussion with the management,

82
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,840
and if they are agreeable, you can come for two days, three days, one day, and give service.

83
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,260
Service is always good for you.

84
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,320
May you all develop in dhamma, get established in dhamma, for your good, and for the good

85
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,540
of so many others.

86
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,040
May you all keep on growing in dhamma.

87
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,460
May you all keep on growing in dhamma.

88
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:38,180
May you all keep on growing in dhamma.
