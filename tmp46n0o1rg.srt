1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,840
Well, you have finished your 110-day Vipassana course, but this is not enough.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:18,060
Now you have to see how to apply it in your day-to-day life.

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:26,580
You will go out, you have to face the world, and whatever equanimity you have learned here,

4
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,660
you see that you apply that in your life in spite of all the difficult situations.

5
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:41,900
You know, I also know, the world is such that it is so difficult to apply equanimity in

6
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,460
life, but this is what you have to learn.

7
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:59,380
For that, one important way is that you learn it in the atmosphere of a Dhamma center where

8
00:00:59,380 --> 00:00:59,980
the course is going on.
